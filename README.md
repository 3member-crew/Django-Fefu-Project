# Django-Fefu-Project
A dynamic website written on Django

The website is a prototype of a marketplace for Far Eastern Federal University's students. 

The aim is to make a self-sufficient and automated website for students to make purchases and sell personal belongings.

Layout of the site:
TODO: pic1_homepage
TODO: pic2_account
TODO: pic3_search_query

Users are able to create accounts using their personal information, post listings and contact each other through a social network (VKontakte). Transactions are not currently available and will have to be discussed between seller and buyer in private messages.
